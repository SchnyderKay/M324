**Start**
After a brief discussion, the team quickly agreed on a topic for the module. To my delight, we decided on an API that supports my BMA and will save me a lot of time. 

**Teamwork**
We were able to quickly agree on a basis as a team. Both the code and the rules for dealing with the code and the team were quickly defined for the team and the goal of our work was also quickly clear to everyone.

**Teamwork**

I am very pleased that the teamwork has worked well so far. The team is working well together and communication is going as planned. The tasks are distributed fairly and worked out carefully. 

**My work**

*Database*
Setting up the database was associated with minor difficulties, as not everyone had the necessary programmes for the database. Apart from this point, the installation went smoothly thanks to the instructions

*Rules*
I took on the task of defining rules for branching and pushing. This went well, as we were quickly able to agree on common methods as a team.

*Kanban*
The creation of the Kanban board also went well on the whole, as we were able to quickly define tasks together. In addition, the distribution to the participants was simple and without conflicts.

**Teamwork**

Today was the first day that I was not satisfied with my team. someone was not on site and did not inform us about it and did not share the task he had started with us. As a result, we lost a lot of time today and may have to rework at home to make up for this mistake

**My work**
*Project skeleton*
My task was to complete the skeleton and then write unit tests. 
Combining the database with the existing backend led to various problems and I had to fall back on the help of my team again and again. They were happy to help me even when they were behind schedule with their task. 
Fortunately, we were all able to complete our task in the end

**Teamwork**

We were able to work better as a team today because the tasks were easier to divide up. 
Communication between the individual tasks was also better. 
As a team, we are generally happy that we can work together as a team and not separately, as it is easier to communicate quickly in the event of minor uncertainties.


**My work**
*Unit tests*

We (Kay and I) started by comparing my unit tests with the given criteria. we quickly realized that although the unit tests were good, a bad example was missing for each case. we adjusted and completed this during the course of the morning. 

*Errorhandler*

To create the bad examples, we also had to create an error handling system. 
This was the only way to ensure that the tests we created would actually work.

**Teamwork**

Working together has gone very well. 
We are beginning to know who is working on what and where the difficulties lie. 
Our biggest problem at the moment is the internet. we are losing a lot of time waiting for the pipeline or the backend to build and run. 
Aryan has volunteered to continue the documentation and luca to connect everything to AWS. 
I'm glad that we don't have any verbal complications and that we can agree very quickly. 
Everyone is working and helping each other and the project is taking shape.

**Improvement**

I think we can improve on the division as soon as the tasks allow it. 
Luca started helping us with the programming today. 
In the long term, kay and i should also take over part of the documentation and involve aryan in programming as well,
so everyone has the opportunity to contribute.


**Feedback Yves**
Mir ist im Journal vor allem die Reflektion wichtig. Was kann man verbessern. Wie nimmst du den Prozess war. Wie ist die Zusammenarbeit. Versuche also zu reflektieren - nicht nur oberfl√§chlich.
Was du gemacht hast, sehe ich in den Tasks, das ist hier nicht mehr wichtig.

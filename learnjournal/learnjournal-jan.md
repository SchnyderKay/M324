**Start**
After a brief discussion, the team quickly agreed on a topic for the module. To my delight, we decided on an API that supports my BMA and will save me a lot of time. 

**Teamwork**
We were able to quickly agree on a basis as a team. Both the code and the rules for dealing with the code and the team were quickly defined for the team and the goal of our work was also quickly clear to everyone.

**Teamwork**
I am very pleased that the teamwork has worked well so far. The team is working well together and communication is going as planned. The tasks are distributed fairly and worked out carefully. 

**My work**

*Database*
Setting up the database was associated with minor difficulties, as not everyone had the necessary programmes for the database. Apart from this point, the installation went smoothly thanks to the instructions

*Rules*
I took on the task of defining rules for branching and pushing. This went well, as we were quickly able to agree on common methods as a team.

*Kanban*
The creation of the Kanban board also went well on the whole, as we were able to quickly define tasks together. In addition, the distribution to the participants was simple and without conflicts.

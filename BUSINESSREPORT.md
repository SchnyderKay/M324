# Businessreport

## Overview: 

The project tracked and managed tasks using a ticket system that segmented the work into areas such as documentation, enhancements, testing, and setup. 
The total estimated hours for completion was 117 hours, but actual hours spent came to 159 hours, indicating a 36% overrun due to additional requirements discovered during project implementation.

## Summary of Key Areas:

**Documentation:**

Documentation tasks included everything from the initial creation and theory writing to protocols and documentation of specific implementations, such as branching rules and the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. 
Some notable documentation tickets and discrepancies include:

- Threeway Theory Documentation (Ticket #9): Estimated at 8 hours, but took 10 hours due to revisions for accuracy.
- DevOps Theory Documentation (Ticket #23): Estimated at 3 hours but took 8, as adjustments to DevOps processes required in-depth explanation.
- Continuous Deployment Theory (Ticket #50) and other smaller documentation tasks generally matched estimates.

Overall, documentation exceeded its initial estimate by approximately 20 hours, highlighting a need for additional detail and clarity.

**Enhancements:**

Enhancements covered areas such as the CI/CD pipeline, tool and environment setup, and additional features. 
Major efforts included:

- CI Pipeline (Ticket #5): 
Initially estimated at 3 hours but required 5 hours, involving several configuration refinements post-deployment.
- CD Pipeline (Ticket #53): 
This major enhancement task was estimated at 10 hours but took 20 hours, largely due to challenges with the integration  and testing complexities.
- Logger (Ticket #77): 
This task was initially projected to take 3 hours, ultimately consuming 10 hours due to detailed logging requirements.

Enhancements represented the largest deviation, contributing significantly to the overall project hours exceeding initial estimates.

**Testing:**

Testing involved both unit and integration testing efforts. 
The tasks highlighted the importance of thorough testing to ensure project stability:

- Unit Tests (Ticket #20): 
This was one of the most extensive testing tasks, with an initial estimate of 6 hours but required 10 hours.
- Integration Tests (Ticket #44): 
Estimated at 3 hours but took 8 hours as it covered the integration of complex components across the project.
Testing tasks, on average, exceeded their estimates by approximately 50% due to additional debugging and verification requirements.

**Question and Setup Tasks:**

Tasks under this category involved early project setup and question-based decision-making. Most setup tasks stayed within or close to initial estimates. Example tasks include:

- Decide Tools and Environment (Ticket #6): 
Completed within its 1-hour estimate, showing efficient decision-making.
- Gather Ideas for Project (Ticket #8): 
Stayed within the estimated time, aligning with the initial project plan.

## Key Insights:

**Time Overrun and Causes:**

While the project met its core objectives, the time overrun highlights areas for potential optimization. Complexities in enhancements and testing contributed significantly to the overrun, particularly due to the in-depth requirements of the CI/CD pipeline and logger functionality.

**Documentation Needs:**

Documentation tasks also required more time than expected, indicating a need for initial drafts or template creation to streamline documentation processes.

**Team Efficiency and Task Estimation:**

Team efficiency can be improved by refining initial estimates and allowing buffer time for complex tasks, particularly those involving integration and testing. 
Future projects could benefit from a time-tracking tool that aligns closer to real-time feedback, potentially improving forecast accuracy.

## Future Recommendations:

**Increased Buffer for Enhancements and Testing:**

Allocate additional hours for enhancements, particularly those related to integration or CI/CD tasks. 
These tasks often involve unforeseen adjustments, and a larger time buffer could improve estimation accuracy.

**Streamlined Documentation Process:** 

Develop templates or detailed outlines to assist with documentation, especially for technical write-ups. 
This would save time while ensuring that essential information is consistently included.

**Improved Estimation for Complex Tasks:**
Regular reassessment of task estimates for projects with numerous integration points could further refine accuracy and help avoid underestimations.

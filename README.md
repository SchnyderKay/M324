# Documentation

## PROJECT DEFINITION

Our application gives the user the opportunity to use a dropdown menu and choose an ingredient (ex. Gin, Vodka,Cola, Tonic). 
Based on the decision the application checks a database filled with cocktails and provides the user with all the possible cocktails with the chosen ingredient (ex. Gin Tonic, Vodka sour, Cuba Libre).
The Cocktails will be editable via CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints.

## Branching

In our project, we adopted a branching strategy that enables parallel development while ensuring the main branch remains stable and ready for deployment. 

### Rules
Never push directly to the main branch. Always create a new feature branch from the main and create a pull-request to the main branch. The branch name starts with the ticket number-name and a short description of the task. Example: 1-documentation-add-definition

To contribute your work, create a new branch according to the branch naming rules. This branch can be used as a topic or feature branch. To merge the branch, create a pull-request and ask for a code review. The branches are deleted after accepting the merge request. Additionally, for the optional learn journal, please create a personal branch, which will be merged at the end of the project.

### Branching Flow:
- **Main Branch**: Holds production-ready code.
- **Develop Branch**: Used for integrating completed features before release.
- **Feature Branches**: Created for new features or bug fixes, named after the ticket (e.g., 36-CI/CD-Theory), linked to backlog tasks.
- **Personal Branches**: Each team member maintains a personal branch for their own notes or experiments, which isn't merged into the main codebase.
- There is no **release branch** currently since the project isnâ€™t releasing code yet.

![Branching Strategy Diagram](./Images/Ourworkflow.png)
In this Image we show an example of how our Github Workflow & Commits are being pushed.

### Commit Rules:
- No commit limit, but messages must be clear and concise.
- Force-pushing allowed.
- Only commit on your own branches.

### Merge Criteria:
- All tests must pass and pipelines must succeed.
- No debug logs are permitted in pull-requests.
- Each pull-request must be reviewed and approved by at least one other coworker before merging.
- Delete branch after merging.

This strategy accelerates development, ensures independent work without disrupting the main codebase, and maintains a stable main branch.

## Meetings

The weekly will be every Tuesday at 8:30 o'clock.
At the meeting the team checks and updates the Kanban board and discusses the tasks in progress.
During the meeting, problems are discussed and open tasks are assigned to the members. 
The aim of the meeting is for everyone to know what they need to work on afterwards without having to request further feedback from anyone. 

Additionally a protocoll is written to ensure, that everyone on the team can look up their tasks and open discussion points.

## Enviroment

We will write our Frontend in Typescript React and our Backend in Java.
Every collaborator can use the IDE they prefer.

## Coding Rules

- Names of classes should be in camel case. 
- Names of variables and functions should be in lower camel case. 
- Names should be chosen with purpose behind them. 
- Code should be written with readability in mind. Readable code should be understood without having to ask somebody else for an explanation to achieve this the code has to be documented and the functions shouldn't have repeated code and should be kept as small as possible. 
- Logic and endpoints should be unit tested. 
- The application should be built on the REST principals.
- Have the SOLID priciples in your mind while coding.

## Database

### Manuel Setup

To setup the Docker container use the command given below
```
docker-compose -f ./DrinkDomain-main/docker-compose.yaml build
```

When the container is running you can start DBeaver and follow the instructions:

**Step 1**

ðŸ”´ Start by clicking the icon shown in the image.

![step 1](./Images/1.png)

**Step 2**

ðŸ”´ Insert "prostgres" in the password area.
ðŸŸ¢ coninue by clicking finish.

![step 2](./Images/2.png)

**Step 3**

ðŸŸ¢ Aftrer creating a connection, click on SQL in the navbar.

![step 3](./Images/1.png)

**Step 4**

Insert the SQL statement given 

[SQL file](DrinkDomain-main/backend/drinks_db.sql) 

ðŸ”´ Afterwards click the run script to create a table with data.

![step 4](./Images/4.png)

### Start Backend and DB

To start the backend, a terminal must be started in the IDE. 
In the terminal, navigate to the backend using â€˜cdâ€™ and execute the following command:

``` docker-compose up -d ```

## CI Pipeline

The Docker Build and Test CI Pipeline is set up to ensure the project builds successfully and passes all tests before deployment. It runs automatically on any branch push or pull request, except branches tagged with "personal."

### Pipeline Workflow

1. **Build and Test**:
   - Runs on an Ubuntu environment with JDK 18 set up (Corretto distribution).
   - Uses Gradle to build the project (skipping tests initially) and then runs tests to validate code functionality.
   - A test report is generated and uploaded as an artifact for easy review.

2. **Docker Image Creation**:
   - Pulls the necessary PostgreSQL image to include the database in the Docker environment.
   - Builds the Docker image using docker-compose, creating an environment that includes both the backend and the database.
   - Saves the completed Docker image as an artifact (`image.tar`) for potential deployment or further testing.

By the end of the pipeline, both the test report and Docker image are preserved as artifacts, providing a clear snapshot of the build and test state for each commit or pull request. This ensures a consistent, tested environment ready for the next deployment stage.

## Ticket System
Our ticketing system lets users create tickets directly through the frontend when they need help or have a request.
Each ticket, created under the DrinkDomainSupport account, appears in our Issues section and can be tagged as documentation, bug, or enhancement. 

Once a ticket is created, itâ€™s reviewed and moved to the Kanban board for prioritization.
During Sprint planning, the team decides if it should go into the upcoming Sprint based on priority and resources.
Each ticket also receives an estimate for effort and a detailed description to ensure the assigned team member has all necessary context to start work smoothly.

This process keeps our workflow organized and efficient, making sure all tickets are ready to go with clear information and assigned priority before work begins.

## Time

Every collaborator must fill in his own time on the time sheet.
For every work time the collaborator must fill in the task they worked on and the required time.
The time must be entered to the nearest 15 minutes.

[Time Sheet](https://tbzedu-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/kay_schnyder_edu_tbz_ch/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B4C0BDA20-4AE3-4985-A780-3F4F67B43329%7D&file=time_logger%201.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&wdOrigin=TEAMS-WEB.p2p_ns.rwc&wdExp=TEAMS-TREATMENT&wdhostclicktime=1724143689247&web=1)


## User Stories
The user stories are used to imitate the behavior of a user. 
We can use these stories to build tests and logic into our application.
This simplifies the planning and creation of tickets.

![user stories](./Images/userStories.png)

## Classification figures

We use two different kinds of classification figures, which are used in the business report. For the first we used all metrics from our tickets, which gives us different information about our work process. All the information about the tickets can be found [here](https://tbzedu-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/kay_schnyder_edu_tbz_ch/ETEOqXSWJ_NElX9zm-97S48BYXe6KywImw80YmzvvCs97Q?e=njes6M).

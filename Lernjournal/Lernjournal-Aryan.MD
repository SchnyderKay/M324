# Learning Journal

## 20 August 2024

### Activities

- **Planning and Organization:**
  - Our group came together to discuss the overall plan for this module. We identified the key tasks that needed to be completed and established a timeline to ensure everything was organized.
  - We broke down the module's requirements into actionable tasks and assigned responsibilities to each group member.

- **Repository and Ticket Creation:**
  - We set up a new GitHub repository to manage our project code and documentation.
  - Tickets were created in the GitHub backlog to track the progress of each task. We used these tickets to assign specific tasks to team members, ensuring that everyone knew their responsibilities.
  - We also added labels and deadlines to the tickets to prioritize the work efficiently.

- **Assigned Tasks:**
  - I was responsible for researching and completing the theoretical task on the CALMS framework. This involved studying the concepts and preparing a summary that would be useful for the group.

### CALMS Framework Insights

- **Culture:** The foundation of DevOps, focusing on collaboration and communication between teams. A strong culture reduces silos and fosters shared responsibility.

- **Automation:** Automating repetitive tasks, such as testing and deployment, to increase efficiency and reduce human error. Automation is key to achieving consistent and reliable results.

- **Lean:** Emphasizing the importance of continuous improvement, waste reduction, and maximizing value. Lean principles guide the team to focus on delivering value quickly and effectively.

- **Measurement:** Tracking performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement. Measuring progress is crucial for making informed decisions and driving continuous improvement.

- **Sharing:** Promoting knowledge sharing across teams to build a strong learning culture. Sharing ensures that best practices are adopted and challenges are addressed collaboratively.

### Reflection

Initially, we felt like we were thrown into cold water, as we didn't have a clear understanding of what DevOps entailed. It was challenging to figure out the module's requirements and what needed to be done. However, as a group, we quickly found our footing. Through effective planning and communication, we were able to distribute tasks evenly and work towards our goals efficiently.

Our group dynamic improved as we collaborated on task assignments and supported each other in understanding complex topics. This teamwork allowed us to make significant progress, and we are now almost finished with the tasks due next week. The experience highlighted the importance of good planning and communication, which will be critical as we continue working on this module.

### Activities

- **CALMS Theory Completed:**
  - I finalized the research and documentation for the CALMS framework, making sure all key concepts were thoroughly understood and articulated for the team.
  
- **Reviewed Three Ways Theory:**
  - As a group, we reviewed the Three Ways theory, which is essential in understanding DevOps principles. We discussed its implications and how it can be applied to our project.

- **Skeleton Project Setup:**
  - I assisted in setting up the skeleton of our project, laying down the basic structure and organizing the initial files and directories.
  
- **Database Setup:**
  - We set up the initial database for the project, ensuring that the necessary tables and schemas were created to support our application's functionality.

- **Backlog Tickets Filling Out:**
  - Continued to fill out and refine the backlog tickets in GitHub, adding more detailed descriptions and setting priorities for upcoming tasks.

### Reflection

This week was productive as we completed several key tasks, including finalizing the CALMS theory and setting up the project’s foundational components. Working through the Three Ways theory provided us with a deeper understanding of DevOps principles, which will be valuable as we move forward.

Our ability to collaborate effectively has improved, especially in setting up the project infrastructure and organizing our workflow through backlog tickets. This structured approach is helping us stay on track and ensuring that everyone is clear on their responsibilities. Overall, the progress we’ve made this week has been encouraging, and we are well-prepared for the next steps.

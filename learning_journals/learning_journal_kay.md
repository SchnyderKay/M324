# Learning Journal Kay

## 20.08.2024

Today was a productive day. My team, consisting of Jan., Aryan, Luca, and I, started working together on this project. First, I was quite confused about what exactly the task was and how to execute it properly. I'm not the biggest fan of GitHub and Kanban, so it took me a while to get used to working with them. My main task today was to create the Kanban board and the GitHub repository and create the necessary tickets together with my team. It was fascinating to hear about the perspective of my colleagues on certain DevOps topics, mainly because I'm not too familiar with that subject. I now understand that the way it's handled in my company isn't very effective and efficient. So this module is a good way to learn more.

After our daily meeting, we sorted out our chaos on the Kanban board. As soon as everything was sorted out again, we started working. My main task was helping Jan set up the database for our project. Afterward, I started working on the theory of the DevOps processes, where I learned about the Software Development Life Cycle and the DevOps Lifecycle. It was difficult to decide which information was usable from the research and which was not. For both of these subjects, there were multiple different versions of how many phases there are and when things are done. I wasn't able to finish it completely, so I'm going to finish it next week.

**Feedback Yves**: Es geht hier mehr um eine Reflektion als darum was du gemacht hast. Was könnte man verbessern in eurem Prozess oder was war der Prozess den ihr durchlaufen seit. Wie ist das Modul für dich persönlich und was nimmst du mit, resp. steckst du rein etc

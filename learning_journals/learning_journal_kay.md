# Learning Journal Kay

## 20.08.2024

Today was a productive day. My team, consisting of Jan., Aryan, Luca, and I, started working together on this project. First, I was quite confused about what exactly the task was and how to execute it properly. I'm not the biggest fan of GitHub and Kanban, so it took me a while to get used to working with them. My main task today was to create the Kanban board and the GitHub repository and create the necessary tickets together with my team. It was fascinating to hear about the perspective of my colleagues on certain DevOps topics, mainly because I'm not too familiar with that subject. I now understand that the way it's handled in my company isn't very effective and efficient. So this module is a good way to learn more.
